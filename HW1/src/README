To compile the program quickly, compile.sh can be used.

Usage:

./server [port] [nreps]

./client [port] [nreps] [nbufs] [bufsize] [ip/hostname] [type]

Server starts listening on the port supplied for client to connect. After
connecting, a timer is started. The client then sends nbufs buffers of 
bufsize size nreps times, and the timer lapped. Finally, after receiving
confirmation from the server, the client ends the timer. Timing data is then
printed to the console, and raw data to cerr for easy use in statistical
analysis.

The runclitest and runservtest scripts allow quick testing of all the cases
multiple times. The script directs the cerr raw output to an output file by
default. The raw data makes it easy to import into excel to do statistics on
the info.
